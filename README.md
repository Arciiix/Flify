### Stream PC audio or microphone to mobile easily, in the blink of an eye. You're on your PC that doesn't have Bluetooth and you want to use your portable speaker? Use this app. Or even if your computer has Bluetooth, it is limited in range of usability - want to extend your area of music as much as you like? This app is a perfect fit.

Made with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [naudiodon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/naudiodon) (PortAudio wrapper for Node.js, it doesn't require having PortAudio on the machine) and... my own [easy-volume library](https://github.com/Arciiix/easy-volume).

# Run
See the **Releases** tab. 
Download the latest desktop app - either the installer or the unpacked version - and the latest mobile app.

The app will work out-of-the-box.

# Build
If you want to build the app by yourself, follow the instructions:

## Build desktop app
Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to be installed on your machine.

Developed on Node.js v18.13.0.

```bash
cd desktop
npm install

npm run build
```
Your app will be built in two ways:
* As a standalone, unpacked app - in ```desktop/dist/win-unpacked```
* As a installer - in ```desktop/dist/Flify Setup <version>.exe```


## Build mobile app
Requires [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) to be installed on your machine.

Developed on Flutter 3.10.5 and Dart 3.0.5.

```bash
cd mobile

flutter pub get

flutter build apk --split-per-abi
# or
flutter build apk # results in a heavy APK that contains the code compiled for all the target ABIs, not preferred

```
